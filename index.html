      <h2>Rules : </h2>
      <h3>
        Setup : 
      </h3>
      Tablut is a game of attackers (black) versus defenders (white).
      The atackers outnumber the defenders, but the defenders don't have to capture to win. Their main objective is to secure their king (center pawn).
      The king follows the same movement and capturing rules as the other pawns.
    </p>
    <p class="rules">
      <h3>
        Movement: 
      </h3>
      Pawns can move to any tile in a vertical or horizontal direction, but they can never jump over other pawns.
      Pawns can not move on or over the center tile. Once the king leaves this tiles, he can also no longer cross it.
    </p>
    <p class="rules">
      <h3>
        Capturing : 
      </h3>
      Capturing is done by surrounding an opposing pawn from bothsides with your own pawns.
      Pawns can also be captured by blocking them against the center tile. This works for both players.
    </p>
    <p class="rules">
      <h3>
        Victory : 
      </h3>
      The defenders win when they can move their king to any edge of the board.
      The attackers win when they capture, or if the can prevent all defenders from moving.
